# Networks

Once your smart contract has been written, you must deploy it on a network.



## Bytecode

A smart contracts must to be compiled to byte code before it can be deployed on the network. 



##  ABI (Application Binary Interface)

The ABI is necessary for defining how the contract can be interacted with, and how data is extracted from the raw bytes on the wire.
