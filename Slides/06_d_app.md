## Metamask

MetaMask is the easiest way to interact with dapps in a browser. It is an extension for Chrome or Firefox that connects to an Ethereum network without running a full node on the browser's machine. It can connect to the main Ethereum network, any of the testnets (Ropsten, Kovan, and Rinkeby), or a local blockchain such as the one created by Ganache or Truffle Develop.

## Metamask limitations

The web3 object is stored in the global windows objet. It means that another website can access this object from your browser. It's very dangerous and unsecure. Never use Metamask with a real ethereum account.
