## Truffle

A framework which simplify a lot the deployment, unit testing



## Metamask



## Ganache

A test blockchain for your development environment.
Available on cli or GUI
The GUI has a useful block explorer



## Metamask limitations

The web3 object is stored in the global windows objet. It means that another website can access this object from your browser. It's very dangerous and unsecure. Never use Metamask with a real ethereum account.
